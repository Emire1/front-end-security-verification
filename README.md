# Front-end security verification app
This is a simple front-end javascript security application that allows a user to match a picture. 
If the picture matches you will be congratulated if not you will be allowed to reload the page.

* Since Javascript is not a low-level programming language, scanning pixel via vanilla javascript would require too much work
so I broke down the pictures into smaller pieces like a puzzle with the help I got from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43322063/how-to-break-an-image-into-9-small-ones-sort-of-puzzle-pieces
Thanks to LGSon.
* I also got some help with the event handlers for the drag and drop action from https://medium.com/quick-code/simple-javascript-drag-drop-d044d8c5bed5 
Thanks to David Brennan.
